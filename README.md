# Spinexus
A custom SpinShare client to download custom charts and mods, written in Rust with Dioxus.

**This project is currently a work in progress.** The current focus is to get a functional application before working on the UI, so it is preferable to stick with the official SpinShare client.

This project is meant to be a simple program that uses the SpinShare API to deliver custom songs. It is by no means created to compete against or replace the official client.
